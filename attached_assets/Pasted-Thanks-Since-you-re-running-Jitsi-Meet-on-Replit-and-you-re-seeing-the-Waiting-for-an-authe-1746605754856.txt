Thanks! Since you're running **Jitsi Meet on Replit**, and you're seeing the **‚ÄúWaiting for an authenticated user‚Ä¶‚Äù** message, here's a **step-by-step guide to fix it** specifically for Replit environments:

---

## üõ† Problem

Your Replit-hosted Jitsi instance is likely using a **‚Äúsecure domain‚Äù** configuration, which **requires a moderator (authenticated user) to join first**.

This works by requiring:

* The doctor to **log in with a username and password**
* Or by using a **JWT token** if you're on Jitsi-as-a-Service (JaaS)

---

## ‚úÖ Solution (Replit Setup)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 1: Allow Anyone to Start the Meeting (Disable Auth)

If you **don‚Äôt need authentication** (e.g., testing or MVP):

1. In your Replit files, look for the Jitsi config file:

   * Likely in: `/etc/prosody/conf.avail/yourdomain.cfg.lua` (or similar)
   * In Replit, this might be mounted under a different path ‚Äî look in the server setup code or `.sh` files

2. **Change this line**:

   ```lua
   authentication = "internal_hashed"
   ```

   ‚û§ To:

   ```lua
   authentication = "anonymous"
   ```

3. Make sure guest domain is configured:

   ```lua
   VirtualHost "guest.yourdomain.com"
     authentication = "anonymous"
   ```

4. Restart services in your Replit `server.js` or `start.sh`:

   ```bash
   sudo service prosody restart
   sudo service jicofo restart
   sudo service jitsi-videobridge2 restart
   ```

Now anyone can start a meeting without needing to log in.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 2: Let Doctor Log In First (Keep Auth Secure)

If you want only the **doctor to be moderator** (recommended for real apps):

1. Create a moderator account:

   ```bash
   sudo prosodyctl register doctor yourdomain.com strongpassword
   ```

2. When doctor joins, they should click "Log in" and enter:

   * Username: `doctor`
   * Password: `strongpassword`

3. Patients will wait until the doctor (moderator) starts the call.

### üîí Optional (Advanced): Use JWT for Auth in Replit

If you're using [Jitsi-as-a-Service (JaaS)](https://jaas.8x8.vc/), you can:

* Pass a **JWT token** to authenticate users (doctor as moderator)
* Configure roles and user types via token claims

Let me know if you're on **JaaS** and want help generating or integrating JWTs.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Goal                  | Action                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anyone can join       | Set `authentication = "anonymous"`                                  |
| Doctor logs in first  | Keep `authentication = "internal_hashed"` and create doctor account |
| Use token-based login | Use **JWT with JaaS**                                               |

Would you prefer to disable auth for now or set up a doctor login securely?
