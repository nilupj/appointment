Here’s a **step-by-step process** of how a **patient and doctor video consultation** works, typically in a telemedicine system:

---

### ✅ **1. User Registration/Login**

* **Patient** and **doctor** register or log in.
* Role-based access is granted (e.g., patients can't access doctor dashboards).

---

### ✅ **2. Doctor Profile Setup**

* Doctors add:

  * Specialty
  * Available time slots
  * Qualifications
  * Fees

---

### ✅ **3. Appointment Booking**

* Patient:

  * Searches for a doctor by specialty or name.
  * Selects a time slot.
  * Books an appointment.
  * Makes payment (if required).

* System sends confirmation to both doctor and patient via email/SMS.

---

### ✅ **4. Video Consultation Link Generation**

* The system creates a **secure video room** using:

  * Jitsi, Zoom SDK, Agora, or Twilio
* A **unique room URL or ID** is generated.
* Only the doctor and the patient can access it at the scheduled time.

---

### ✅ **5. Notification & Reminders**

* Automated reminders are sent (email, push, or SMS).
* Link or button to “Join Video Call” is provided in dashboard/email.

---

### ✅ **6. Live Video Consultation**

* At appointment time:

  * Patient and doctor join the video room.
  * Real-time discussion, diagnosis, or visual inspection occurs.
  * Features: mute, chat, screen sharing, file sharing (if enabled)

---

### ✅ **7. Prescription & Notes**

* Doctor:

  * Enters notes
  * Generates **e-prescription**
  * Recommends tests or follow-ups

* Patient can view/download prescriptions in their profile or email.

---

### ✅ **8. Post-Consultation**

* Patient may:

  * Book follow-up
  * Rate/review the doctor
  * Contact support

* Doctor may:

  * Update EMR (Electronic Medical Record)
  * Add to case history

---

### ✅ **9. Admin Monitoring (Optional)**

* Admins can:

  * Manage users
  * See analytics
  * Handle support issues
  * Oversee payments & reports
