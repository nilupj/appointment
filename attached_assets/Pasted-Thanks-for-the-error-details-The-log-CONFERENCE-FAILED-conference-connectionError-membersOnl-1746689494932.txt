Thanks for the error details. The log:

```
CONFERENCE FAILED: conference.connectionError.membersOnly mc-23yp0jerm@lobby.meet.jit.si
```

confirms that your **Jitsi room is locked with "membersOnly" mode**, meaning:

> üîí Only **authenticated or moderator-approved users** can join ‚Äî others are stuck in the lobby.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Fix This (Based on Your Use Case)

### üîπ **Option 1: Let the Doctor Admit the Patient (Recommended for Real Use)**

1. **Doctor opens the meeting link first**.
2. Doctor gets **moderator rights** (automatically if using JWT or authenticated session).
3. When the patient joins, the doctor sees a **prompt to admit them from the lobby**.
4. Doctor clicks **"Admit"**, and the patient joins.

> üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Make sure the doctor joins first or no one can admit the patient.

### üîπ **Option 2: Disable `membersOnly` for Testing (Not Secure)**

If you're just testing and want anyone to join directly:

1. On your **Jitsi server config**, open:

   ```bash
   /etc/prosody/conf.d/yourdomain.cfg.lua
   ```
2. Find and set this:

   ```lua
   lobby_muc = "lobby.yourdomain.com"
   main_muc = "conference.yourdomain.com"

   -- Comment out or set:
   -- "members_only = true" -> remove or set false
   ```
3. Restart Prosody:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart prosody
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This change disables the lobby for all rooms.

### üîπ **Option 3: Use JaaS (Jitsi as a Service) for Easier Auth**

* Jitsi‚Äôs hosted solution lets you easily manage:

  * Lobby
  * User roles (moderator, guest)
  * Tokens for room control

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Doctor admits patient | Doctor joins first, patient waits in lobby |
| No lobby/testing      | Disable `membersOnly` in Jitsi config      |
| Better auth/control   | Use JWT or JaaS for role-based join        |
