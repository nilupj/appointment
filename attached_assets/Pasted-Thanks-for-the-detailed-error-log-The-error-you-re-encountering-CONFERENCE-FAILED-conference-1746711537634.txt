Thanks for the detailed error log. The error you're encountering:

```
CONFERENCE FAILED: conference.connectionError.membersOnly
```

means that **the patient is trying to join a Jitsi room that is set to "members only"**, and they are **not authorized** or **not yet accepted** from the lobby.

---

## ‚úÖ What This Means

Your Jitsi room has the **lobby feature enabled**, which requires:

* A moderator (like the doctor) to be **present and admit** the patient manually.
* OR, the joining user must be a **member (authenticated)** and not just a guest.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix It

### Option 1: Let the Doctor Admit the Patient (Quick Fix)

* Ask the doctor to **join the meeting first**.
* The patient will show up in the **lobby** (a popup will prompt the doctor).
* The doctor **clicks "Admit"** to let the patient in.

This is default behavior when using Jitsi‚Äôs lobby feature.

---

### Option 2: Disable the Lobby Feature (if not needed)

If you're embedding or self-hosting Jitsi, you can disable the lobby using the **Jitsi config.js** file:

```js
// In your Jitsi Meet config (config.js):
enableLobby: false,
```

If you're using a public server like `meet.jit.si`, you **can‚Äôt disable this**‚Äîyou must follow Option 1.

---

### Option 3: Automatically Join with Moderator Role (Advanced)

To bypass the lobby entirely:

* Use **JWT tokens** to join as a moderator (requires a self-hosted Jitsi setup with JWT auth).
* That way, the patient can also be a moderator and skip the lobby.
